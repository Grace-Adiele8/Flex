            Flex is the best and easiest way to manage your multiple
            subcriptions. It gives you the freedom to control and keep track of
            your expenses.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            By signing up for a Flex Account (as defined in Section 2) or by
            using any Flex Services (as defined below), you are agreeing to be
            bound by the following terms and conditions. <br /><br />
            As used in these Terms & Conditions, “we”, “us” and “Flex” means the
            applicable Flex Contracting Party (as defined in Section 5 below).
            <br /><br />
            The services offered by Flex under the Terms & Conditions include
            various products and services to help you manage and control your
            subscriptions online. Any new features or tools which are added to
            the current Services shall be also subject to the Terms and
            Conditions. You can review the current version of the Terms and
            Conditions at any time at https://www.flex.ng/legal/terms. Flex
            reserves the right to update and change the Terms and Conditions by
            posting updates and changes to the Flex website. You are advised to
            check the Terms and Conditions from time to time for any updates or
            changes that may impact you, and if you do not accept such
            amendments, you must cease using the Services
            <br /><br />
            You must read, agree with and accept all of the terms and conditions
            contained or expressly referenced in these Terms and Condition
            before you may sign up for a Flex Account or use any Flex Service.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h4>2. Account Terms</h4>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            To access and use the Services, you must register for a Flex account
            (“Account”) by providing your full legal name, country, phone
            number, a valid email address, and any other information indicated
            as required. Flex may reject your application for an Account, or
            cancel an existing Account, for any reason, in our sole discretion.
            <br /><br />
            You must be the older of: (i) 18 years, or (ii) at least the age of
            majority in the jurisdiction where you reside and from which you use
            the Services to open an Account. <br /><br />
            You acknowledge that Flex will use the email address you provide on
            opening an Account or as updated by you from time to time as the
            primary method for communication with you. <br /><br />
            You are responsible for keeping your password secure. Flex cannot
            and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to
            maintain the security of your Account and password. <br /><br />
            A breach or violation of any term in the Terms and Conditions, as
            determined in the sole discretion of Flex may result in an immediate
            termination of your Services.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h4>3. Payment Methods & Payment Accounts</h4>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Upon completion of sign up for the Service, Flex will create a
            Paystack and Flutterwave account on your behalf, using your email
            address.
            <br /><br />
            You acknowledge that Paystack and/or Flutterwave will be your
            default payment gateway(s) and that it is your sole responsibility
            to maintain these accounts. If you do not wish to keep either of the
            payment accounts active, you can resort to our E- wallet feature.
            For the avoidance of doubt, Paystack and Flutterwave are Third Party
            Services.
